Collection of scripts and utilities i wrote during my doctoral degree to generate defects in zirconium-based metal-organic frameworks and process the results of computational work.

Utilities:
cp2k-restart-to-cif.py - to convert a CP2K restart file to cif format
xyz-to-cif.py - to convert xyz files to cif format given a set of cell parameters
crystal-to-cif.py - to convert a CRYSTAL output (DFT software, versions 14 or 17) to cif format
chk-to-cif.py - to convert a YAFF chk file to cif format
